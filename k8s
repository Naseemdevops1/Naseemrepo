1. Container Orchestration
Kubernetes automates how containers are deployed, scaled, and operated in production environments.

2. Self-Healing
If a container crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it, reschedules it, or replaces it.

3. Scaling
Kubernetes can automatically scale your application up or down based on CPU or custom metrics.

4. Load Balancing
Distributes network traffic across containers to maintain stability and performance.

5. Service Discovery
Assigns IPs and DNS names to services, so containers can find and communicate with each other.

6. Rolling Updates and Rollbacks
You can update your application with zero downtime and easily roll back if something goes wrong.
